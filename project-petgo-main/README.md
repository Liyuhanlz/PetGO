#### Introduction
Oftentimes pet owners have issues with taking care of their pets' needs, due to a lack of resources or knowledge. They can lose precious time with their pets just by scrambling to take care of them! On their own, pet owners also can oftentimes lack a way to form proper routines with their pets, so they may require assistance to form a routine. How might we help pet owners increase quality time with their pets in a way that supports both their routines and their pets' well-being?
